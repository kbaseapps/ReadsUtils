        If local files are specified for upload, they must be uncompressed.
        Files will be gzipped prior to upload.

        If web files are specified for upload, a download type one of
        ['Direct Download', 'DropBox', 'FTP', 'Google Drive'] must be specified too.
        The downloadable file must be uncompressed (except for FTP, .gz file is acceptable).

        If staging files are specified for upload, the staging file must be uncompressed
        and must be accessible by current user.

        Note that if a reverse read file is specified, it must be a local file
        if the forward reads file is a local file, or a shock id if not.

        If a reverse web file or staging file is specified, the reverse file category must match
        the forward file category.

        If a reverse file is specified the uploader will will automatically
        intereave the forward and reverse files and store that in shock.
        Additionally the statistics generated are on the resulting interleaved file.

        Required parameters:
        fwd_id - the id of the shock node containing the reads data file:
            either single end reads, forward/left reads, or interleaved reads.
        - OR -
        fwd_file - a local path to the reads data file: either single end
            reads, forward/left reads, or interleaved reads.
        - OR -
        fwd_file_url - a download link that contains reads data file:
            either single end reads, forward/left reads, or interleaved reads.
        download_type - download type ['Direct Download', 'FTP', 'DropBox', 'Google Drive']
        - OR -
        fwd_staging_file_name - reads data file name/ subdirectory path in staging area:
            either single end reads, forward/left reads, or interleaved reads.

        sequencing_tech - the sequencing technology used to produce the
            reads. (If source_reads_ref is specified then sequencing_tech
            must not be specified)

        One of:
        wsid - the id of the workspace where the reads will be saved
            (preferred).
        wsname - the name of the workspace where the reads will be saved.

        One of:
        objid - the id of the workspace object to save over
        name - the name to which the workspace object will be saved

        Optional parameters:
        rev_id - the shock node id containing the reverse/right reads for
            paired end, non-interleaved reads.
        - OR -
        rev_file - a local path to the reads data file containing the
            reverse/right reads for paired end, non-interleaved reads,
            note the reverse file will get interleaved
            with the forward file.
        - OR -
        rev_file_url - a download link that contains reads data file:
            reverse/right reads for paired end, non-interleaved reads.

            reverse/right reads for paired end, non-interleaved reads.

        single_genome - whether the reads are from a single genome or a
            metagenome. Default is single genome.
        strain - information about the organism strain
            that was sequenced.
        source - information about the organism source.
        interleaved - specify that the fwd reads file is an interleaved paired
            end reads file as opposed to a single end reads file. Default true,
            ignored if rev_id is specified.
        read_orientation_outward - whether the read orientation is outward
            from the set of primers. Default is false and is ignored for
            single end reads.
        insert_size_mean - the mean size of the genetic fragments. Ignored for
            single end reads.
        insert_size_std_dev - the standard deviation of the size of the
            genetic fragments. Ignored for single end reads.
        source_reads_ref - A workspace reference to a source reads object.
            This is used to propogate user defined info from the source reads
            object to the new reads object (used for filtering or
            trimming services). Note this causes a passed in
            insert_size_mean, insert_size_std_dev, sequencing_tech,
            read_orientation_outward, strain, source and/or
            single_genome to throw an error.
        min_read_length - minimum allowed read length to keep in the reads object (Defaults to 1).
