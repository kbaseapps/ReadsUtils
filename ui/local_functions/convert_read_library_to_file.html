<p>Example python usage:</p>

<pre>
    from kb_read_library_to_file.kb_read_library_to_fileClient import kb_read_library_to_file
    from kb_read_library_to_file.baseclient import ServerError

    def __init__(self, config):
        #BEGIN_CONSTRUCTOR
        self.callbackURL = os.environ['SDK_CALLBACK_URL']
        ...

    def my_method(self, ctx, params):

        ...
        readcli = kb_read_library_to_file(self.callbackURL, token=ctx['token'],
                                          service_ver='dev')
        reads_params = {'read_libraries': ['256/24/1', '256/26/2'],
                        'gzip': 'false',
                        'interleaved': None}

        try:
            reads = readcli.convert_read_library_to_file(reads_params)
        except ServerError as se:
            self.log('logging stacktrace from reads client error')
            self.log(se.data)
            raise
        ...
</pre>

<p> The reads object will contain filepaths for the reads files and the
available data from the workspace objects for those files as per the method
specification.<p>
